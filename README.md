## Installation

Follow the steps below to install BuJo Bullets.

1. Search for "BuJo Bullets" in Obsidian's community plugins browser
2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find "BuJo Bullets" under "Community plugins").
5. Start creating bullets in your notes using the [BuJo Bullets syntax](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers).

## Getting Started

BuJo Bullets adds support for the following bullet types:
```markdown
- [ ] incomplete task
- [x] completed task
- [-] irrelevant task
- [>] migrated task
- [<] scheduled task
- [o] event
```

When in Obsidian's reading mode, the bullets will be displayed using the following icons:

## Signifiers

This plugin also allows you to add signifiers to your bullets. Signifiers are added to the start of any bullet and are highlighted to help you quickly identify added context.

By default, the exclamation point `!` and the question mark `?` are supported as signifiers. You can update these and/or add your own signifiers by updating the plugin settings.

### Right-click Menu
You can right-click on any of the supported bullet types to open a context menu that will allow you to change the bullet type.

Per [Obsidian's recommendations](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/Commands#Hot+keys) default hotkey values are not set, but here are some suggestions:
- Change to "incomplete task" - `Ctrl/Cmd + I`
- Change to "completed task" - `Ctrl/Cmd + D`
- Change to "irrelevant task" - `Ctrl/Cmd + ~`
- Change to "migrated task" - `Ctrl/Cmd + >`
- Change to "scheduled task" - `Ctrl/Cmd + <`
- Change to "event" - `Ctrl/Cmd + shift + o`

Keep in mind, for "incomplete task" and "completed task" types you can use Obsidian's default hotkey for toggling checkboxes: `Ctrl/Cmd + L`
